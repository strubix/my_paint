# Installation :
You'll need bower installed on your computer to get materialize's css and javascript file and jQuery.
Use bower update command to add dependencies to your website and make sure the element youre using with the plugin is a canvas.
Then refer to the mainscript.js file to see how to apply the plugin to your website.

It's my first project, i hope you'll enjoy it ! :)
